= Lab 1 - Pushing Your First Application

[abstract]
--
The prime directive of Pivotal Cloud Foundry is to host applications. We are going to exercise that directive by pushing a very simple Spring application.

By the end of this lab you should have your attendees application up and running in your account.
--

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

== Download git repo (if not done already)

. Download and clone the git repo, if you have the command line tool installed, or you can click 'Download ZIP' on the right side of the page https://github.com/shiva-pivotal/pcf-java-workshop
+
----
> git clone https://github.com/shiva-pivotal/pcf-java-workshop.git
----

== Navigate to the application directory

. Open a command prompt in Windows (or Terminal on Mac) Navigate to /pcf-java-workshop/deployables/articulate directory
. Open the manifest.yml file in your text editor and update the username to your unique username so that we can differentiate your app from other workshop attendee's app.
For example, below is the name value changes in my manifest.yml file. Remember to preserve the space after _name:_
 
 Previous value:
 name: changeMeToUniqueUsername-articulate
 New value:
 name: shiva-articulate
 
 Complete manifest.yml file :
 
 applications:
- name: shiva-articulate
  path: ./articulate-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  instances: 1
  memory: 1024M
  disk_quota: 1024M
  stack: cflinuxfs2

== Target

. If you haven't already, set the API target for the CLI: (set appropriate end point for your environment)
+
----
> cf api https://api.dev.sys.pcfonemagnify.com

Setting api endpoint to https://api.dev.sys.pcfonemagnify.com...
OK

API endpoint:   https://api.dev.sys.pcfonemagnify.com
API version:    2.112.0
----
and login to Pivotal Cloudfoundry:
+
----
> cf login
----
+
Follow the prompts. 

== Push It!

. Push the application from */pcf-java-workshop/deployables/articulate* directory!
+
----
> cf push
----
+
You should see output similar to the following listing. Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what's happening:

<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, the stack to be used (in this case cflinuxfs2), the number of instances requested to start, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _shiva-articulate_ in the assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with your unique application name to prevent route collisions across the default `cfapps.io` domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Notice that it's uploading _139 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually uploads all the files for the deployment for caching purposes.
<6> Now we begin the staging process. By choosing the cflinuxfs2 stack a container is created on the runtime to prepare the application to run, a second container is then generated that will host your application...in this case using the Tomcat app server in Linux.   
<7> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more Cells in the _https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html[Diego Architecture]_ for execution.
<8> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<9> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.
====

. Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI and is accessible in the *urls* section above - in my example, it is https://shiva-articulate.cfapps.io:

== Interact with App from CF CLI

. Get information about the currently deployed application using CLI apps command:
+
----
> cf apps
----
+
You should see output similar to the following listing:
+
----
> cf apps

Note the application name for next steps

. Get information about running instances, memory, CPU, and other statistics using CLI instances command
